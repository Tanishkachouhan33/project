Project Overview

The YouTube Data Analysis Dashboard provides insights into channel performance, subscriber base, content uploads, earnings, and viewership trends across countries and categories.
For this project, the dataset required data cleaning and preprocessing in Python to ensure accuracy. After cleaning, machine learning techniques were applied for clustering, prediction, and anomaly detection.

📌 README – Stress Detection Dashboard
📖 Project Overview

The Stress Detection Dashboard analyzes lifestyle, demographic, and behavioral factors that contribute to stress. Unlike the YouTube project, the dataset here was already preprocessed, so the analysis focused entirely on visualization and extracting meaningful insights.

🔑 Key Features

General Lifestyle Metrics

Average Sleep Quality: 3.85

Average Screen Time: 4.1 hrs/day

Average Social Interaction: 3.2

Average Work Hours: 8.26 hrs/day

Average Physical Activity: 3 hrs/day

Average Sleep Duration: 6.3 hrs/day

Smoking Habits

61.81% Non-smokers

38.19% Smokers

Stress & Screen Time

High stress correlates with higher screen time.

Married individuals have more screen time compared to single/divorced.

Stress by Gender

Males report higher high-stress levels (23.16%) than females (15.78%).

Exercise & Sleep Quality

Strength Training (31.69%) and Cardio (27.81%) show the best impact on sleep quality.

Travel Time

Balanced distribution: Female (50.32%) vs Male (49.68%).

📊 Visualizations

The dashboard includes:

Percentage of Smoking Habit

Average Screen Time by Stress Level

Stress Level by Gender

Average Screen Time by Marital Status

Sleep Quality by Exercise Type

Travel Time Distribution

⚙️ Tools & Technologies

Power BI – Dashboard creation & visualization

Excel/CSV Dataset – Preprocessed dataset used directly

Python (optional) – For additional validation if needed

✅ Conclusion

The analysis shows that:

Stress is strongly linked to screen time, work hours, and lifestyle habits.

Exercise significantly improves sleep quality, reducing stress.

Males report slightly higher stress than females.

Non-smokers form the majority, but smokers are more prone to stress.

This dashboard can be used by organizations, healthcare experts, and wellness programs to monitor stress patterns and recommend lifestyle interventions.
